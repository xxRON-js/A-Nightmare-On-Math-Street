## Description
This repository contains Python scripts designed for solving math questions received from a remote server. The scripts utilize the [Pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/) library for interaction with the server.

## Scripts

### Pymare-V2.py
just hardcoded

### Pymare_V3.py

Enhanced version that only prints less just hardcoded for get the flag fast.

### Pymare_V4.py

Enhanced version that not only prints less but also asks for the IP address and port interactively instead of being hardcoded.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pymare-scripts.git
    cd A-Nightmare-On-Math-Street
    ```

2. Run the desired script:

    ```bash
    python3 Pymare-V2.py
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 Pymare_V3.py
    ```
    or

    ```bash
    python3 Pymare-V4.py
    ```
